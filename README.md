# Bitcoin or Gold, which one has more potential?

Gold is the safe asset investors have historically bought to protect themselves during times of market turmoil. Bitcoin instead is a digital asset which people predict to become the ‘digital gold’ of the future. These two articles take two opposite view over the future of bitcoin, supporting their views with thoughtful data:

## Article 1

Lawrence Lewitinn and Omkar Godbole’s article, ‘[Why Bitcoin Isn’t a Replacement for Gold Just Yet]( https://www.coindesk.com/first-mover-bitcoin-is-not-gold-just-yet)’,  does not support the hypothesis that bitcoin will replace gold any time soon. The article highlights how investors tend to sell gold and invest in bitcoin only when there is positive market belief. 

For example, as the news of “90% efficacy rate of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine” spread Gold price lost 5% and bitcoin gained 2%.  This trend suggests that investors do not see bitcoin as a safe asset to hold in volatile periods, but rather a speculative asset to buy when the economy is recovering. 

## Article 2

Now, what Larry Light’s article, ‘[Bitcoin Could Replace Gold as a Refuge, BlackRock Says]( https://www.ai-cio.com/news/bitcoin-replace-gold-refuge-blackrock-says/)’ is highlighting is a direct picture of people buying bitcoin and selling gold as an alternative. This is something that was not socially accepted ever before.

The article shows that gold lost 9% over the month of July, meanwhile bitcoin gained over 65%. 
This proves that people are selling Gold and buy Bitcoin, supporting the hypothesis that digital assets are consolidating their presence and are proving to be a viable alternative to Gold.

All in all, Bitcoin and gold are intrinsically different. Gold will always be a safe bet for investors as its volatility has been historically low, whereas bitcoin is still extremely volatile. It will still take some time before a final judgment can be revealed regarding the success of bitcoin as a digital asset.
